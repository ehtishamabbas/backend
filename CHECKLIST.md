# Node.js Backend Conversion Checklist

This checklist helps ensure that all aspects of the Python backend have been successfully converted to Node.js.

## Core Functionality

- [x] Token management and authentication with Trestle API
- [x] Property listing crawling and data processing
- [x] MongoDB integration for data storage
- [x] Google Cloud Storage integration for image storage
- [x] Image processing and compression
- [x] Scheduled crawling tasks
- [x] REST API endpoints for frontend integration

## API Endpoints

- [x] `/api/listings` - Get listings with filtering and pagination
- [x] `/api/listings/:listingKey` - Get listing details by key
- [x] `/api/listings/property-type` - Get property types and subtypes
- [x] `/api/autocomplete` - Get search suggestions
- [x] `/proxy-image` - Proxy images to avoid CORS issues
- [x] `/api/counties-images` - Get county images
- [x] `/health` - Health check endpoint

## Infrastructure

- [x] Project structure and organization
- [x] Environment variables configuration
- [x] Docker configuration for containerization
- [x] Docker Compose for orchestration
- [x] Logging system
- [x] Error handling
- [x] Security configuration
- [x] API documentation (Swagger/OpenAPI)

## Testing

- [x] API endpoint testing
- [x] Feature parity testing with Python backend
- [x] Performance testing
- [x] Load testing
- [x] Environment validation

## Deployment

- [x] Deployment guide
- [x] CI/CD configuration
- [x] Monitoring setup
- [x] Production security measures

## Frontend Integration

- [x] TypeScript interfaces for API responses
- [x] Example API client implementation
- [x] React component example
- [x] Configuration for switching between backends

## Documentation

- [x] README with setup instructions
- [x] API documentation
- [x] Deployment guide
- [x] Frontend integration guide
- [x] Environment variables documentation

## Before Switching to Frontend Branch

- [ ] Run comprehensive tests (`npm run test:all`)
- [ ] Verify feature parity with Python backend
- [ ] Check performance metrics
- [ ] Ensure all endpoints return expected data
- [ ] Validate security measures
- [ ] Test with real frontend requests

## After Switching to Frontend Branch

- [ ] Update API base URL in frontend configuration
- [ ] Test all frontend features with Node.js backend
- [ ] Verify image loading and proxying
- [ ] Check search and filtering functionality
- [ ] Test pagination and sorting
- [ ] Validate property detail pages
- [ ] Ensure autocomplete works correctly

## Final Steps

- [ ] Deploy Node.js backend to staging environment
- [ ] Run final integration tests with frontend
- [ ] Document any remaining issues or improvements
- [ ] Create backup of Python backend
- [ ] Switch production to Node.js backend
- [ ] Monitor performance and errors after deployment
